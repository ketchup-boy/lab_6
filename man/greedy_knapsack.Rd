\title{Greedy Approximation Knapsack Solver}
\usage{
greedy_knapsack(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing two columns: \code{v} (values) and \code{w} (weights).}

\item{W}{A numeric value representing the maximum capacity (weight) of the knapsack.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{value}{The total value of the selected items.}
\item{elements}{The indices of the items selected to maximize value.}
}
\description{
Uses a greedy algorithm to solve the knapsack problem by selecting items with
the highest value-to-weight ratio first. This is an approximation algorithm
and may not always return the optimal solution.
