\title{Dynamic Programming Knapsack Solver (Optimized)}
\usage{
knapsack_dynamic_programming_optimized(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing two columns: v (values) and w (weights).}

\item{W}{A numeric value representing the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{max_value}{The maximum value that can be obtained.}
\item{selected_items}{The indices of the selected items that maximize the value.}
}
\description{
Solves the knapsack problem using dynamic programming with pruning to optimize memory usage.
It fills a dynamic programming table and backtracks to find the selected items.
