\usage{
brute_force_knapsack_parallel(x, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame containing two columns: \code{v} (values) and \code{w} (weights) for each item.}

\item{W}{A numeric value representing the maximum capacity (weight) of the knapsack.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{value}{The maximum value that can be obtained.}
\item{elements}{The indices of the items selected to obtain the maximum value.}
\item{weight}{The total weight of the selected items.}
}
\description{
Solves the 0/1 knapsack problem using a parallelized brute force approach.
This function divides the search space across multiple processors to improve performance,
especially for large numbers of items, by evaluating chunks of possible combinations in parallel.
}
\details{
This function evaluates all possible combinations of items using brute force, but to improve
performance, it evaluates chunks of combinations in parallel using the \code{parallel} package.
Each chunk of combinations is processed separately, and the best combination is selected.
